My experiments with machine learning.

* `notMNIST_with_Keras.ipynb`: I used the Keras library to train dense and convolutional neural networks to recognize (classify) letters with stylized fonts in images.
* `agglomerative-sentence-clustering.ipynb`: automatically group sentences and their translations from a large corpus of multilingual parallel sentences (notebook exported from my Kaggle account).
* `count_kanji_in_text.py`: simple utility script that counts the number of time a Japanese [kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji) (character) appears in a document.
